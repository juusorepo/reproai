  "overview": "**OVERVIEW:**\n\nThe manuscript exhibits partial compliance with key reporting guidelines, with notable strengths in describing the sampling procedure and providing detailed demographic information of the study sample. However, it falls short in several areas critical for ensuring the study's reproducibility and transparency.\n\n**Strengths:**\n- The paper effectively describes the sampling procedure and provides comprehensive demographic details of the participants, which supports the reproducibility of the study.\n\n**Gaps:**\n- Critical gaps include the lack of information on the blinding of researchers, the allocation of participants into groups, and the handling of data exclusions, which are essential for assessing the study's validity and bias.\n\n**KEY RECOMMENDATIONS:**\n\n1. **Specify Blinding Procedures:**\n   - *Add details on whether the researcher was blind to the experimental conditions and hypotheses.*\n   - *Importance:* Enhances the credibility of the findings by minimizing potential biases.\n\n2. **Clarify Participant Allocation:**\n   - *Provide information on how participants were allocated into groups, including whether the allocation was random.*\n   - *Importance:* Essential for understanding the study design and assessing the risk of selection bias.\n\n3. **Detail Data Exclusion Criteria:**\n   - *Include pre-established exclusion criteria and the rationale behind data exclusions.*\n   - *Importance:* Increases transparency and allows for a more accurate interpretation of the results.",
