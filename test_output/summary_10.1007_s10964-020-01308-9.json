  "overview": "### Overview:\n- The manuscript exhibits partial compliance with reporting guidelines, demonstrating strengths in detailing data collection procedures and specifying participant demographics but showing gaps in methodological transparency.\n- **Strengths:** It excels in providing detailed descriptions of data collection instruments and procedures, which aids in reproducibility. Additionally, it clearly identifies the research sample and provides relevant demographic information.\n- **Gaps:** The most critical gaps include the lack of information on the blinding of researchers, random allocation of participants, and reasons for participant dropout, which could impact the study's validity and reliability.\n\n### Key Recommendations:\n- **Specify Blinding Details:** Clarify whether researchers were blind to conditions and hypotheses during data collection. *This is crucial to minimize bias and enhance the study's credibility.*\n- **Detail Participant Allocation:** If applicable, describe how participants were allocated to groups, emphasizing whether the process was random. *Randomization is fundamental for reducing selection bias and ensuring the validity of causal inferences.*\n- **Explain Dropout Reasons:** Provide reasons for participant dropout or non-participation. *Understanding dropout reasons is vital for assessing the generalizability and reliability of the findings.*",
