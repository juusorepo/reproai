  "overview": "### Overview:\n- The manuscript demonstrates a high level of compliance with reporting guidelines, particularly in detailing data collection procedures and participant demographics, which are crucial for reproducibility.\n- **Strengths:** The detailed description of the data collection process and the comprehensive demographic information enhance the transparency and reproducibility of the research.\n- **Gaps:** The most critical gaps include the lack of specification on whether anyone other than participants and researchers were present during data collection and the absence of a predetermination method for sample size.\n\n### Key Recommendations:\n- **Specify Presence During Data Collection:** Clarify whether individuals other than participants and researchers were present during data collection. This is important for understanding potential biases or influences on the data.\n- **Describe Sample Size Determination:** Provide a rationale or method for the chosen sample size to ensure the study's statistical power and representativeness.",
