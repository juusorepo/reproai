  "overview": "### Overview:\n- The manuscript demonstrates moderate compliance with reporting guidelines, with detailed data collection and sampling procedure descriptions enhancing reproducibility.\n- **Strengths:** The detailed description of data collection instruments and stratified sampling enhances the study's reproducibility and validity. \n- **Gaps:** Critical gaps include the lack of information on data collection dates, participant dropout rates, and whether data saturation was considered for qualitative data.\n\n### Key Recommendations:\n- **Specify data collection dates:** \n  - *Importance:* Helps in assessing the study's relevance and temporal context.\n- **Report participant dropout rates and response rates:** \n  - *Importance:* Essential for evaluating the study's internal validity and potential biases.\n- **Discuss data saturation for qualitative data (if applicable):** \n  - *Importance:* Ensures comprehensive data collection and supports the validity of qualitative findings.",
