  "overview": "### Overview:\n- The manuscript exhibits low compliance with standard reporting guidelines, lacking in several areas critical for reproducibility and transparency.\n- **Strengths:** It provides a rationale for the study sample chosen, leveraging theories to underscore the significance of its focus on social-emotional learning (SEL) and group dynamics.\n- **Gaps:** The most critical gaps include the absence of details on data collection procedures, participant demographics, and the statistical rationale for sample size, undermining the study's reproducibility and the clarity of its research context.\n\n### Key Recommendations:\n1. **Detail the data collection procedure:** Including instruments used, to enhance the reproducibility of the research.\n   - *Importance:* Clarity on data collection methods is fundamental for other researchers to replicate or build upon the work.\n   \n2. **Provide participant demographics and representativeness:** To contextualize the findings and assess their applicability to broader populations.\n   - *Importance:* Understanding who the research pertains to is crucial for evaluating the relevance and impact of the findings.\n\n3. **Explain the rationale for sample size and statistical methods:** To justify the study's design and ensure the reliability of its conclusions.\n   - *Importance:* Transparent reporting of sample size determination supports the validity of the research outcomes.",
