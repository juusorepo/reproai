  "overview": "### Overview:\n- The manuscript exhibits a high level of compliance with reporting guidelines, particularly in detailing data collection procedures, participant allocation, and sample characteristics.\n- **Strengths:** It excels in providing detailed information on data collection, participant allocation, and the rationale behind sample selection, which are crucial for reproducibility and understanding the study's context.\n- **Gaps:** The most critical gaps include the lack of details on the presence of others during data collection, blinding of researchers, and specifics on participant dropout or non-participation.\n\n### Key Recommendations:\n1. **Detail the presence of others during data collection.**\n   - *Importance:* Enhances transparency and understanding of the data collection environment.\n   \n2. **Clarify researcher blinding to conditions and hypotheses.**\n   - *Importance:* Critical for assessing potential biases in data collection and analysis.\n   \n3. **Provide specifics on participant dropout or non-participation.**\n   - *Importance:* Essential for evaluating the study's external validity and the representativeness of the findings.",
