  "overview": "### Overview:\n- The manuscript demonstrates moderate compliance with reporting guidelines, with strengths in detailing data collection procedures and sample characteristics but has notable gaps in methodological transparency.\n- **Strengths:** It excels in providing detailed descriptions of the data collection instruments and the sampling procedure, which are crucial for the reproducibility of the research.\n- **Gaps:** The most critical gaps include the lack of information on the blinding of researchers, the absence of data collection dates, and details regarding participant dropout or non-participation.\n\n### Key Recommendations:\n- **Specify Blinding Details:** Clarify whether the researcher was blind to conditions or hypotheses during data collection. *This is vital for assessing potential biases in data collection and analysis.*\n- **Include Data Collection Dates:** State the start and stop dates of data collection. *This information is essential for understanding the temporal context of the study and its relevance to current findings.*\n- **Report on Dropout/Non-participation:** Provide details on participant dropout rates and reasons for non-participation. *This transparency is crucial for evaluating the study's external validity and potential selection biases.*",
