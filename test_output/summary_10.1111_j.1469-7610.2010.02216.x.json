  "overview": "### Overview:\n- The manuscript demonstrates partial compliance with reporting guidelines, with detailed data collection procedures enhancing reproducibility but lacking in random allocation and data exclusion transparency.\n- **Strengths:** The detailed description of data collection instruments and methods is a strong point, ensuring clarity on how data was gathered and assessed.\n- **Gaps:** The most critical gaps include the absence of information on participant group allocation and whether any data were excluded from analyses, which are vital for evaluating the study's validity and bias.\n\n### Key Recommendations:\n- **Clarify Participant Allocation:** \n  - *What needs to be added/changed:* Explicitly state if and how participants were allocated into groups.\n  - *Why it's important:* To assess the potential for selection bias and ensure the replicability of the study design.\n  \n- **Disclose Data Exclusion Details:**\n  - *What needs to be added/changed:* Include information on any data excluded from the analyses.\n  - *Why it's important:* Transparency about data exclusion is crucial for understanding the analysis's comprehensiveness and integrity.",
